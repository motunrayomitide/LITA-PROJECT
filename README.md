![REVENUE BY REGION 2015](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b0c3d6-057e-4478-b9de-59c4e8c1dafe)


INFERENCES

* Overall Revenue Trend: Looking at the grand total for each year, We noticed a decline in the total revenue in all the regions from 2014 to 2015, which suggests that there is a potential challenge in the market conditions.

Strategic implications and suggested solutions

* The decline in the total revenue from year 2014  t0 2015 could mean that the market is saturated or there is an increase in competition. it could also result from stockouts or poor inventory management which can have a negative effect on customer satisfaction.
* Suggested solution is that competitors positioning should be reviewed and enhancing in-store experirnces should be considered. Investing in efficient inventory management system  and diversifying suppliers to ensure availability of product at all times should also be put into consideration.



2. REGIONS BY UNIT SOLD.

INFERENCES

From the graph above we notice that the highest performing region in term of unit sold is the North East, then we have the remaining following, South west, South South, South East, North West and North Central respectively. 

* This indicates that the North East region is the region w with strong brand recognition, customer loyalty and demand for product..
* To avoid decline in the unit sold in the North East region, efficient supply chain and inventoey management should be in place to prevent stockouts and to meet the demand of their customer on time. Having a local warehouse and distribution centers and also strengthen their logistics network will be of greater advantage.



3. REVENUE BY LINE OF BUSINESS ( FILTERED BY REGION)

INFERENCES

From the chart above, we can see that service plan is the highest selling line of business in all the regions ( revealed through the use of slicers) 
* This may be justified by increased investment in marketing research or operational enhancement to grow that revenue stream. it can also indicate the Organization's strength and competence in that area of offering Service plan.
* To increase the profit generated from that line of business, more resourses such as budhet and personnels can be allocated to this line of business(LOB) to support its growth. Focusing more on this LOB should also be put into consideration.



4. AVERAGE REVENUE BY REGION.

![AVERAGE REVENUE BY REGION](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/235ba731-d026-46f1-a441-2e1b4e0b4068)

INFERENCES

The region with the highest average revenue is North Central. we can deduce from here that region with the highest total revenue does not necesarily have the highest average revenue due to the price of products available in store. 

* High average revenue could indicate a sales of High-priced product by a region compared to the other regions.
* To maintain this, more focus should be on that particular product that is high priced to increase revenue in that region.


CONCLUSION

Our analysis revealed that the North East region has the highest revenue  and also emerged as the top performing region in terms of units sold. It was also discovered that the Line of business "Service Plan" is the top selling product and finally, we found out that the region with the highest average revenue is North central as against North East having the highest total revenue. By implementing targeted intervntion such as reviewing competitors positioning in the regions, investing in efficient inventory management system, diversifying suppliers to ensure availability of product at all times, to prevent stockouts. More revenue should also be allocated to the top selling line of business which in this case is SERVICE PLAN and finally, focused should be on the high priced product in the region with high average revenue. in addition, Local warehouses,good logistics network and also distribution centers could be established across regions
